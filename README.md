# Parousia

**Parousia** is the prologue to an experimental trilogy of CD-ROM games, each a recursive exploration into selfhood, liminality, and the uncanny. *Parousia* begins with the player alone, in a basement that is both decrepit and unnervingly sentient—a realm where memory and illusion intertwine, blending the boundaries of perception and reality. Influenced by classic point-and-click adventures like *Myst*, but with fewer traditional puzzles and an emphasis on shifting landscapes and surreal encounters, *Parousia* invites players to experience an existential, dreamlike journey through spaces that may or may not exist.

### About Parousia

In *Parousia*, the player finds themselves a silent wanderer in a cryptic ruin, navigating dimly lit rooms and darkened hallways where objects and surroundings seem to shift when least expected. The player isn’t a hero, nor a passive observer, but a figure haunted by the shadows of the basement—a basement that acts less like a structure and more like a mental echo chamber of memories scattered and forgotten.

The game’s world is sparse yet heavy with implications; players uncover cryptic artwork, strange objects, and doorways that lead back upon themselves. Objects can be interacted with, but interactions yield no clear answers. Hallways loop, rooms appear and disappear, and moments of eerie clarity are immediately followed by new layers of uncertainty.

### The Trilogy: Themes and Progression

Each installment of the trilogy takes the player deeper into a recursive, shifting world where understanding is only ever half-glimpsed, like shapes seen in a fog. Here’s a look at each part:

0. **Parousia** – *Prologue*: Womb-like darkness clings with a digital cold sweat. The journey begins in quiet dread, with only the faintest sense of purpose. Blood from a stone, God from the Machine. You are alone, or so you hope. But soon, you begin to find rooms that weren't there before...

1. **Limbus** – A grand, ornate staircase winds endlessly upward, with ghosts dutifully bearing your bags. Mirrors balk at each other, reflecting impossible depths. "May I have a cigarette?" you ask. "No," they reply. Here, one begins to feel a nagging familiarity—an almost visceral memory—that seems to collapse on itself before it can be grasped.

2. **Tenebris** – A library is found, though it hardly appears as such. The air is thick with ergotic spores, which leave the mind drifting between lucid texts and fevered, debilitating hallucinations. You wander into a cave, hearing footsteps behind you. The farther you journey into the darkness, the more the structure unmasks itself, revealing facets that defy reason—unmathematical forms, perspectives that twist and pull. The self slips, and you find a cavernous space that is perhaps not real, yet undeniably felt.

3. **Numina** – In the final game, you come upon a book titled *Numina*, a collection of poems that speaks of your life and your death, three years past. An old man with a broomstick appears, and, guided by a strange compulsion, you draw your gun and shoot him. As he collapses into skeletal remains, exhaustion overtakes you, and a seizure ensues. In flashes, you see an ascent—an escape—until the game rewinds, pulling you back through every scene and step until you stand before a man named Frederick F. Heritage IV. “You weren’t meant to be the shepherd,” he says, stabbing, shooting, striking, and kicking you until you die. Floating through a void, a voice beckons you toward the light. To step into it is to start the cycle anew—same game, different images, names, and rooms. But if you can find a way out of Bardo, an epilogue game awaits: *Arborea*, where you awaken as a newborn child.

### Gameplay and Features

**Parousia** offers an unconventional, *Myst*-inspired approach to exploration, emphasizing unsettling illusions and shifting spaces over traditional puzzles. Here’s a breakdown of its core gameplay mechanics:

- **Recursive Exploration**: In *Parousia*, players move through a deceptively simple 3D basement where rooms may disappear or warp unexpectedly. Doors that appear straightforward will often loop or open into spaces that shouldn’t be accessible, creating a claustrophobic, maze-like sense of entrapment. There is no map, and the basement offers little guidance.

- **Minimalist Interactivity**: Interactions are limited and surreal. Players may come across cryptic objects—paintings, letters, statues—that are disturbingly familiar but always just out of reach in meaning. Instead of clear objectives, these interactions deepen the player’s disquiet, making the player question both the space and themselves.

- **Illusions and Shifting Perspectives**: Parousia leans heavily into illusions rather than puzzles, creating shifting environments where perception and memory are challenged. Hallways may extend endlessly, mirrors reveal unseen horrors, and objects distort when viewed a second time, adding layers to the sense of unease.

- **Entropy and Randomness**: Each playthrough subtly alters the layout and appearance of objects, as if the game itself resists being fully known. The experience is intended to be both deeply personal and endlessly recursive; what you encounter in one playthrough may vanish in the next, enhancing the fractured nature of memory and perception.

- **Atmospheric Sound Design**: The game’s soundscape is sparse and unnerving, amplifying the silence and emptiness of the space. Minimalistic creaks, distant murmurs, and faint static add a sense of dread, heightening the effect of solitude. Moments of sudden audio distortion or silence play with the player's sense of reality and immersion.

### Technical Information

- **Platform Compatibility**: Developed for Linux (Kubuntu) and macOS.
- **Languages and Libraries**: Written in C, leveraging SDL2 and OpenGL to create a 3D environment that feels both haunted and hollow.
- **Requirements**: OpenGL-compatible hardware, SDL2, and OpenGL libraries are required to engage fully with *Parousia’s* unnerving digital purgatory.
